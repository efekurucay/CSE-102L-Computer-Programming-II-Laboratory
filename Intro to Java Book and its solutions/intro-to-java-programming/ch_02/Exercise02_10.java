 * 2.10 (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed
 * to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
 * should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial
 * and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
 * Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
 * and energy Q is measured in joules. Here is a sample run:
 * <p>
 * Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5
 * Enter the initial temperature: 3.5
 * Enter the final temperature: 10.5
 * The energy needed is 1625484.0
