Elon Musk has an enormous rocket and a tiny house. Last year the multibillionaire
(who is the second-richest person in the world) announced that he was going to sell off most of his physical possessions,
including multiple mansions, and “will own no house”. He appears to have made good on much of that pledge and is now living in a $50,000,
375-square-foot, prefab home in Texas that he rents from his company SpaceX.
To say that Musk has “fans” is an understatement.
He has devotees. The 50-year-old has an army of admirers, most of whom are young and male,
who seem to believe that he is the second coming. Predictably, Musk’s new living arrangements have sparked an orgy of admiration from the MuskBros,
who see it as another example of how their dear leader is selflessly – and modestly – saving the world.
“Reminder: Elon Musk is the richest person globally with a net worth of $193B, and he lives in a $50k foldable home that he rents …
” one guy gushed in a tweet that went viral. “Stop buying stuff you don’t need to impress people you don’t like.”
Now that last bit is very good advice, I’ll grant you that.
But let’s not pretend Musk is living a simple and sustainable lifestyle, shall we?
His new digs aren’t so much an actual home as a $50,000 office; I’m fairly confident he’s not entertaining his six
children there, anyway. It’s easy to eschew possessions when you can afford to get your hands on whatever you want,
 whenever you want it. And while Musk may not technically own a home, his company effectively owns the village of
 Boca Chica where his house is located. SpaceX has been accused of ushering out the village’s residents, many of whom are retirees,
 and pressuring them to sell their homes. Public beaches are reportedly frequently closed with little warning when SpaceX is running tests.
 Musk has also taken the liberty of unofficially renaming Boca Chica “Starbase”. “For better or worse, Boca Chica belongs to Elon now,” TexasMonthly sighed.
