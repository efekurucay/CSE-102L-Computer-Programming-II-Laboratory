/**
 * **7.24 (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics
 * problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from
 * a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
 * objects to be picked at least once.
 * <p>
 * A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
 * a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed
 * before you see one of each suit.
 * <p>
 * Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
 * before picking another.
 * <p>
 * Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
 * to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
 * card may be picked twice).
 * <p>
 * Here is a sample run of the program:
 * Queen of Spades
 * 5 of Clubs
 * Queen of Hearts
 * 4 of Diamonds
 * Number of picks: 12
